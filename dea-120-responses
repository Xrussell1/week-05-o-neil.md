I am a division 1 track and field athlete at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and playing division 1 athletics requires rigor, 
talent, and motivation. Therefore athletic directors and coaches need to find who has the skills to be a part of the team because at 
the end of the day they are trying to maximize their success from an athletic standpoint. In college athletics success brings funding after 
this conversion, it no longer is just a sport but a business. This is where WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) becomes relevant. 

Colleges can use WMD in order to see what athletes they want at their university. But first, 
they need to find out what model will be used to scout athletes. The most efficient things to look for will be grades, discipline, and talent
within track competition. Most college coaches will be intrigued by this model because it breaks things down into simpler terms. In my sport, 
this model will prove to be successful if you are only looking at data such as how fast the athlete is consistently running through each meet? 
This process may prove to be successful for the majority of athletes but not just everyone such as an athlete like me.

" A model is nothing more than an abstract representation of some process" In my life, this process proved to be inaccurate. 
In high school, although I was a great athlete I was underperforming at track meets my senior season which is a crucial year for getting 
recruited to major universities. During this time I was depressed sparked by issues in my personal life. My performances in my sport were 
reflected during this time.  An abstract model often called a WMD will not take my mental health into consideration. WMD will often "punish individuals
who happen to be the exception." If a model like this was used I would be that exception, the outlier who will be punished in a system that seems to be 
perfect proves to be fallible such as how it failed a great teacher like Sarah Wysocki's
